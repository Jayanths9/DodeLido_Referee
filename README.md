# DodeLido Referee- A Deep Learning Project

DodeLido is an amazing card game that keeps you on your toes. The game is simple, each player will put one card in turn in a triangle format and then the player has to tell what is the majority, either the colour or the animal and in case there is a clash, you have to say DodeLido. Simple! And there is sloth and alarm also.

P.S. Yes, we have merged the basic DodeLido game with the DodeLido Extreme version because we like it that way!
